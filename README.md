## Candidates website

This website shows different candidates that applied to a job in "our" website. According to some conditions the candidate is automatically rejected or accepted.

## Comments regarding the code:

### Things that could be added:

 - Search bar to filter the list of candidates by for ex. name.
 - Filters by column, for ex. range of dates, range of age, has_university, graduated, location, accepts_working_hours, had_interview, approved or not.
 - Could add but not priority, order by function to order data alphabeticaly or by date.
 - Pagination of data. Data will tend to increase, so pagination would be a good solution to load data by chunks.
 - As improvement, columns could be passed to the endpoint to retrieve only data needed from the candidates insted of all the columns.
 - Unit tests should be added.
 - Something obvious, add a beautiful navbar...

### Comments: 
 - This was coded trying not to depend from third-party libraries.
